# pynFold - Unfolding with python

![Oh, crumbs!](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/588/23404929566_5c9dfed1ef_o.jpg) 

pynFold (pronounced penfold) is a pythonic implementation of the [RooUnfold](http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/~adye/software/unfold/RooUnfold.html) ROOT Unfolding Framework aiming to compare unfolding methods with those provided outisde of high energy physics and to increase robustness by eliminating dependencies on the ROOT libraries basing algorithms only on numpy.

Unfolding relates to the problem of estimating probability distributions in cases where no parametric form is available, and where the data are subject to additional random fluctuations due to limited resolution. The same mathematics can be found under the general heading of inverse problems, and is also called deconvolution or unsmearing.
